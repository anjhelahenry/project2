  Women are just as capable as men, so let's give them a voice. We have strong opinions and are capable of doing more than you think. We are more than housewives, or maids. We are workers, activists, doctors, lawyers, athletes, and much more. Throughout history, women have fought for their respect, and when it was given to them, everyone disregarded. Women have earned equal rights in this world, and they have yet been given.  In all of my pages, I will be showing how hard women have fought in the past, just to have no progress in the future. My goal through this website is to get people's attention of how women need their respect and equality back.
