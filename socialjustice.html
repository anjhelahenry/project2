Social Justice for women has gotten better, but still needs a lot of work. Women still are stereotyped and given less opportunities because of their gender. They are continually cat called on the streets by men and overlooked in the workplace. Women have been proven to be just as smart as men and they are still treated like they just came out of the womb. In the historical page, it showed that women have overcome a lot of issues in the past, and those are getting taken away by the minute. Womenâ€™s equality day was created to celebrate women and their earned rights, but the world celebrates them by taking those rights away. Women are violted, and abused because they are stereotyped to be weak and fragile. They have still rose up from getting disrespected by men and have not stopped fighting. I believe that women won't stop fighting until they get that deserve.
