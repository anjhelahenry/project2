Women have limited rights when they are obligated to have more. We have to fight for the rights that we should have, and that needs to be put to an end. Women deserve the same respect that men get in the work field, in athletics, and all around the world.  Everyone needs to give respect and the rights back to women. Women shouldnâ€™t be underpaid, or looked at and treated differently because of their gender. Women have been proven to be just as smart and as capable as men, so why don't we treat them that way? If you are someone against women equality, think about your mom, sister, wife, or a women in your life that you love. You wouldn't want them disrespected by men, or given any less chance at success, so why treat other women that way? This needs to come to an end. Please use learn something from this page and take action to end women inequality.
