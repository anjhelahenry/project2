Overtime, women have gotten the right to vote, own property, earn money, and much more, but they didnâ€™t get those rights. It goes all the way back to the 1700's when women weren't able to own property, and got their right to vote taken away. In the 1800's women were able to own property in their name, with only their husbands permission in Mississippi. Women earned rights in the 1800's then they were taken away from them. Arabella Mansfield was the first women lawyer and Ada H. Kepley became the first women to graduate from law school. Victoria Claflin Woodhull became the first female presidential candidate in the US, but after all that progress the Supreme Court rules that married women can't practice law. Woman still fought through, and Susanna Medora Salter becoming the first woman elected as mayor was a big break-through. After, Wyoming grants women rights to vote in all elections, and by 1900 all states passed the legislation law where women can get married and could have property in their name. Then the 19th Amendment is approved where women have the right to vote everywhere. But in 1932 a National Recovery Act forbuds more than one family memeber working, so many women lose their jobs. That still doesn't stop women from pushing through and making great things out of themselves. Frances Perkinds became the first cabinet female member, and Jerrie Cobb became the first women to undergo astronaut testing. In 1963 the Equal Pay Act is passed, and everything starts going up from there.

 Woman have also had a hard time in sports. Woman athletes have to deal with different situations on ands off the fields. Women are objectified by fans, commentators and even coaches and the fight gets so hard for some that they give up on their dreams. Female athletes deal with sexiest comments from men all the time who just come for pleasure and don't think women have any talent at all. Women also have to fight for equal pay in sports. Women are VERY under paid compared to men in the sports area. For over a decade, women have come to the media and all over to fight for more equal pay. Even when women win championships and titles, they don't get respect. Women athletes work just as hard as men, and as a woman athlete myself, I feel we shouldn't have to give up on our dreams just because men don't give us the same respect.
